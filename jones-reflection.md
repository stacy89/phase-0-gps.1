What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  Prior to this session I was struggling with merging branches, pulling, and pushing to GitHub and just using branches.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  This session helped me with the roles of each in the pair, as well as a better understanding of git branching and using GitHub.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  I asked about using git commands outside of a repository, as well how markdown files work.

What still confuses you about Git?
  Recalling the history of a branch, where the branch is now, and whether to delete branches or continue using them.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  I enjoyed my session first GPS; both my partner and the guide were friendly, thoughtful and helpful.  I learn from each of these sessions how other people work, how they think through a problem and verbalize the issues they are having.
