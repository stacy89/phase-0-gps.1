**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I had a pretty good understanding of Git before, but it's nice to keep going over it so that it sticks with me. If I had to pick anything it would probably be merging branches. After practicing it on my own I finally started to get the hang of it. This GPS was really helpful in reminding me how to merge. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

When created markdown I had to google how to make BOLD, Italic, and link. Since we have been learning html I'm completely forgot about what was needed to be done. Thankfully, after looking it up it become clear. One thing that was new was how to use a link in markdown which is clear after looking it up. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?** 

One question I asked my guide was why would someone use "git fetch" instead of "git pull". I was told that some people like to review before merging, while it could be of use to other some might just perfer to use "git pull".

**What still confuses you about Git?**

Everything so far is making a lot of sense. At first I was having a bit of trouble understand Github and pushing up branches to Github. Git and branch have been a lot easier for me to understand then html. Mostly because that are so many tags that I keep forgetting about. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Not going to lie I was really nervous at first only because the thought of a guide being there listening and watching sounded terrifying. Once I got started the fear went away and it became fun. I like the idea of someone there to help us if we both get stuck or have any questions.
